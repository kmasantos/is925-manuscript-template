\section{REVIEW OF EXISTING ALTERNATIVES}
This chapter examines the diverse approaches employed by animal welfare organizations to facilitate animal adoption and sponsorship, focusing on both local and international models. 


\textbf{Pet Adoption Initiatives:}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{The Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS)} which maintains web pages dedicated to showcasing the stories of rescued animals residing in their sanctuary that have been rehabilitated and are now healthy enough for adoption (https://paws.org.ph/adopt/). Visitors can submit their adoption applications along with preliminary responses to help provide initial assessment whether they would be a suitable match for the animal. The assessment process and subsequent steps, such as in-person meet-ups, are conducted manually.

  \item \textit{The Compassion and Responsibility for Animals (CARA Welfare Society)} offers additional opportunities for public involvement. Their website features information on various animals available for adoption, fostering, and/or donation. To facilitate the process, CARA provides Google Forms to capture application details. Subsequent steps, similar to those of PAWS, are handled manually.

  \item \textit{Petfinder.com, powered by the Petfinder Foundation}, is a U.S.-based platform dedicated to preventing animal euthanasia by supporting shelters and rescue organizations. Through grants and resources, Petfinder enhances adoption rates and promotes responsible pet ownership. The platform makes pet adoption more accessible by providing a comprehensive list of adoptable pets in users' local areas, streamlining the process through its user-friendly web application. By connecting potential adopters with animals in need of a home, Petfinder helps reduce the number of pets in shelters and ensures more animals find their forever families.

\textbf{Design Related Platforms:}

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{Adoption Date }is an interactive mobile platform developed by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) to support small shelters in Hong Kong. This platform enables users to explore detailed animal profiles and express their interest in adopting or fostering animals in need. Users can stay updated with push notifications about animals available for fostering or adoption, ensuring they never miss an opportunity to help. With a focus on engagement and real-time updates, Adoption Date streamlines the adoption process and connects potential adopters and foster caregivers with animals awaiting their forever homes.

 \item  \textit{Pawmates: The Dog Meetup App} is a mobile application designed to help dog owners connect with one another and arrange local meetups for their pets to socialize. Each owner creates a profile for their dog, which includes details such as breed, size, temperament, and preferences, helping to match them with compatible dogs for meetups. Using location-based features, the app connects users with nearby dog owners, making it easy to find playmates for their pets.
 \end{itemize}
