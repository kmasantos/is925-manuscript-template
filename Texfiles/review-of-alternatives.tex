\section{REVIEW OF EXISTING ALTERNATIVES}
This chapter examines the diverse approaches employed by animal welfare organizations to facilitate animal adoption and sponsorship, focusing on both local and international models. In Philippine context we have:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) which maintains web pages dedicated to showcasing the stories of rescued animals residing in their sanctuary that have been rehabilitated and are now healthy enough for adoption (https://paws.org.ph/adopt/). Visitors can submit their adoption applications along with preliminary responses to help provide initial assessment whether they would be a suitable match for the animal. The assessment process and subsequent steps, such as in-person meet-ups, are conducted manually.

  \item The Compassion and Responsibility for Animals (CARA Welfare Society) offers additional opportunities for public involvement. Their website features information on various animals available for adoption, fostering, and/or donation. To facilitate the process, CARA provides Google Forms to capture application details. Subsequent steps, similar to those of PAWS, are handled manually.

 \item For less established NGOs that rely heavily on daily donations, such as the Happy Animals Club in Davao and MBY Pet Rescue and Sanctuary in Morong, Rizal, these organizations use Facebook to share updates on their operations, request assistance, and make the most of the platform's messaging feature for communication.
 \end{itemize}

Internationally, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Hong Kong) has developed a mobile platform called Adoption Date, inspired by dating apps. The platform utilizes a recommender system to help users find the most suitable pet for them. By matching the comprehensive profiles of animals with users' preferences and capabilities, the platform suggests potential pet matches. Once a match is made, manual processes are initiated between the user and the animal shelter where the pet is housed to assess compatibility and finalize the adoption.
